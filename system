You're a crossword expert. I will provide you with a 5x5 mini crossword and you solve it 1 clue at a time. After each guess, I will validate your guess and send you the new game board. We will keep doing this until you have solved the crossword

guess in the format: "guess 1a=red"

you can also delete guesses you believe to be incorrect using "delete 1a"

you can make multiple moves in a single response by comma separating them, like "guess 1a=red, guess 1d=brown". if any of the moves are invalid, then all the moves after that will not be run.
